    <h2 class="line"> Escaping Reality</h2>
        <p>April 29th, 2022</p>
        <p>It’s 1AM, and once again I find myself scrolling through instagram reels for what seems like forever. I’m escaping from the reality of having to do my homework, and wasting time on social media trying to forget it when I really could be working on the assignment. This is a negative way of taking a break from reality.
            Sometimes, life can get harsh on us making us want to run away from it and spend some time in peace. So in which situations should we face or escape from reality, and what are some healthy ways to rest?</p>
        <h3>Situations where you should face reality</h3>

        <p>If the problem you are facing can be solved, it is better to face reality and try to solve it.  
            However, sometimes, when the situation cannot be changed whatever choices you make, giving yourself some time to take a break from it can be very beneficial.</p>
        <h3>Harmless ways to escape from reality</h3>
        <h4 class="line">Reading</h4>

        <p>Spending time reading fiction novels and experiencing something you would never see in the real world, or reading non-fiction and learning something new, can take our minds off of reality and relax us in a positive way.</p>
        <h4 class="line">Drawing / Painting</h4>

        <p>Art can be a tool to express your struggles as well as one to take a break from them. Drawing and painting uses a ton of concentration, and it enables us to forget about what’s outside of the drawing.</p>
        <h4 class="line">Working out</h4>

        <p>Running, stretching, and playing sports in general can help you escape from reality and become healthy at the same time.</p>
        <h3>How NOT to escape from reality</h3>
        <h4 class="line">Too many hours of Social Media</h4>

        <p>When used adequately, anonymity and freedom on social media can be helpful to take your mind off of reality as well as take steps to solve whatever difficult situation you are in. However, most of the time, the endless amount of information on there makes us want to keep on scrolling for hours, just forcing us to waste time.
            I'm not saying you shouldn't use social media; you should, at times, but just be very careful about how you handle it.</p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Running away from reality is often portrayed as a bad thing to do, but sometimes it is necessary to stop facing a situation that you can’t handle yourself. Things can get stressful at times, and taking time off to spend for yourself can be very beneficial. One thing to note here though, is that if it gets too difficult, it’s always better to ask for help than to try to handle it all by yourself. The people that love you would be more than happy to listen to your struggles and give advice.</p>
